# Software-Lab-2-Assignment-4
Write a code and implement the following  garbage collection methods to find the garbage nodes in the given heap.
1. Reference Counting method
2. Mark and Sweep method (mark all the nodes of the tree using constant space (i.e. without 
using either recursion or a stack)

Display the output for both the methods in the form of the adjacency matrix separately. Also show 
the garbage nodes that are no longer required.
